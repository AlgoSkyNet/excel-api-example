# excel-api-example
This repo demonstrates the usage of JavaScript Excel API provided by Openfin.

Note: This demo is intentionally coded in plain JavaScript so that its easy to follow,
without any need to understand other technologies/ frameworks.

# How to run the demo

1) Download and run the installer.
[openfin installer download](https://dl.openfin.co/services/download?fileName=excel-api-example-installer&config=http://openfin.github.io/excel-api-example/app.json)

2) Download the [add-in.zip](http://openfin.github.io/excel-api-example/add-in.zip)
extract the zip and load the FinDesktopAddin.xll by double clicking it.
Once its loaded correctly you should see a message in status bar saying "Connected to Openfin", which means
the add-in is loaded and working correctly.

3) At this point you should be able to operate the Excel from either side (Demo App or Excel), and you should
see it mirrored on the other side
